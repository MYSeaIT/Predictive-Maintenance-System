# Daily Monitoring CMC Project Development Procedure

## Introduction
The Daily Monitoring CMC project serves to monitor and manage daily activities efficiently. This document details the development process, including a log of encountered errors, their root causes, and the steps taken to resolve them.

## Development Process
1. **Initial Setup**: Configured Visual Studio Solution for the Daily Monitoring CMC project.
2. **Project Configuration**: Established project configurations for Debug and Release environments.
3. **Feature Development**: Implemented core features following the requirements.
4. **Testing**: Conducted unit and integration tests to ensure feature integrity.

## Error Log
Throughout the development, various errors were encountered. Below is a comprehensive inventory of these issues:

### Error 1: NullReferenceException in Service Layer
- **Cause**: Attempted to invoke a method on a null object reference within the service layer.
- **Resolution Steps**:
  1. Reviewed the stack trace to pinpoint where the NullReferenceException was thrown.
  2. Ensured all objects were properly instantiated before use.
  3. Added null checks as a preventive measure.

### Error 2: Database Connection Timeout
- **Cause**: The application was unable to establish a database connection within the predefined timeout period.
- **Resolution Steps**:
  1. Checked the database server status.
  2. Verified the connection strings in the application's configuration file.
  3. Increased the timeout value to accommodate longer connection times.

### Error 3: Inconsistent Data Display
- **Cause**: Data binding issues in the user interface leading to incorrect or outdated data being shown.
- **Resolution Steps**:
  1. Analyzed the data-fetching and binding logic.
  2. Implemented `INotifyPropertyChanged` to update the UI in real-time when data changes.
  3. Ensured synchronization between the data source and the UI.

## Functional Errors

### Function Error 1: Login Authentication Failure
- **Cause**: Incorrect handling of user credentials validation.
- **Resolution Steps**:
  1. Corrected the logic to compare the stored password hash with the entered password's hash.
  2. Added additional exception handling around the authentication process.
  3. Included meaningful error messages to help end-users understand the login failure reason.

### Function Error 2: Inaccurate Report Generation
- **Cause**: Report generation logic incorrectly aggregated data, leading to inaccurate results.
- **Resolution Steps**:
  1. Identified errors in the report query logic.
  2. Adjusted SQL queries to perform correct data aggregation.
  3. Validated the output against known data sets to ensure accuracy.

*Note: The document will be updated continuously as new errors are discovered and resolved throughout the project lifecycle.*
